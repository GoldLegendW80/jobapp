# jobapp

A self-hosted job-search app for Harald and a few invited friends. It finds postings, scores them against a profile, writes a tailored CV and letter per job, and lets an agent fill application forms in a live browser. It runs as a Docker Compose stack on a Jetson Orin Nano at home and is reached through a Cloudflare quick tunnel.

## Documents

- [CAPABILITY-MAP.md](CAPABILITY-MAP.md): the modules, their dependencies and the build order.
- [SPEC-platform.md](SPEC-platform.md): the platform module (Compose stack, deploy, tunnel), built first.
- [tasks/plan.md](tasks/plan.md) and [tasks/todo.md](tasks/todo.md): the implementation plan and task list of the current module.

## Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env           # then fill in real values; .env is never committed
pre-commit install             # ruff, prettier, eslint, gitleaks and file fixers on every commit
```

## Development on the Mac

```bash
docker compose -f compose.yml -f compose.dev.yml up --build    # api reloads; http://localhost via caddy
pnpm --dir web dev                                             # Vite with hot reload on :5173, /api proxied to :8000
docker compose exec api alembic upgrade head                   # apply migrations
docker compose exec api pytest                                 # backend tests
pnpm --dir web test                                            # frontend tests
pnpm --dir web lint && uv run --directory api ruff check .     # lint
tests/compose_smoke.sh                                         # whole-stack smoke test, then down
E2E_CADDY_URL=http://127.0.0.1 pnpm --dir web exec playwright test caddy.spec.ts   # browser through caddy
```

Caddy (`caddy/Caddyfile`) is the only service with a host port, `${HTTP_BIND:-127.0.0.1}:${HTTP_PORT:-80}`.
It serves the React build baked into its image by the `caddy` target of `web/Dockerfile`, falls back
to `index.html` for client routes, and proxies `/api/*` to `api:8000` with the prefix kept. Set
`HTTP_PORT=8080` in `.env` if port 80 is taken on the Mac.

`docker compose exec api pytest` needs a test database: the smoke script creates `jobapp_test` in the
compose `db` and runs `pytest -m "not docker"` with `TEST_DATABASE_URL` pointing at it.
Migrations live in `api/alembic/versions/`; models register on `app.models_base.Base` and are imported
in `api/app/models.py` so `alembic revision --autogenerate` sees them.

## Deploy to the Jetson

```bash
./deploy.sh                    # preflight, rsync to jetson:~/jobapp, build there, compose up --wait, migrate, health
./deploy.sh --env              # same, and replace the Jetson's .env with .env.jetson
./deploy.sh logs api           # follow the logs of one service (last 200 lines first)
./deploy.sh ps                 # docker compose ps on the Jetson
./deploy.sh stats              # memory and CPU per service
./deploy.sh ssh                # shell in the deploy directory
./deploy.sh url                # the current https://*.trycloudflare.com URL, alone on stdout
./deploy.sh smoke              # checks on the Jetson, then through the public URL; exit 1 if any fails
./deploy.sh smoke --full       # same, plus a database outage and recovery (stops and starts db once)
./deploy.sh backup             # pg_dump to jetson:~/jobapp-backups/YYYY-MM-DD.sql.gz (task 9)
tests/deploy_test.sh           # local tests of deploy.sh: shellcheck, dispatcher, unreachable host, .rsyncignore, url
tests/jetson_smoke.sh          # smoke of the deployed stack over ssh (stops and starts db once)
```

Images are built on the Jetson itself (arm64) with only `compose.yml`. `.rsyncignore` keeps
secrets, `node_modules`, `.venv`, `dist`, `.git` and evidence off the Jetson, and since `.env` is
excluded, `rsync --delete` never removes the Jetson's `.env`. The Jetson's production `.env` is
generated on the first deploy into the git-ignored `.env.jetson` (random `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and
`SECRET_KEY`, `APP_ENV=production`, mode 600) and copied only when the Jetson has none or with
`--env`; `--env` refuses to change `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` once the `pgdata` volume exists. If
`.env.jetson` is lost, the next deploy copies the Jetson's `.env` back. Caddy listens on the
Jetson's loopback only; from the Mac, open it with `ssh -N -L 18080:127.0.0.1:80 jetson` and browse
http://127.0.0.1:18080. `DEPLOY_HOST` and `DEPLOY_DIR` override the target. Deploys are manual;
GitHub Actions only runs lint and tests.

## Public URL

`cloudflared` runs a Cloudflare quick tunnel (free, no account, no domain) from the Jetson to
Caddy. It only makes outbound connections, so no port is opened on the router. The URL is
random and changes every time the container starts (deploy that recreates it, `restart`, reboot):

```bash
curl "$(./deploy.sh url)/api/health"     # {"status":"ok"} from anywhere
```

`./deploy.sh url` reads the logs of the container's current start only, so it never prints the
dead URL of a previous start, and waits up to 30s for a fresh one. `./deploy.sh` prints the URL at
the end. A new hostname can take up to a minute to resolve (the zone's negative DNS cache is 60s);
the smoke backs off and retries rather than hammering it, because quick tunnels are rate limited
and have no uptime guarantee.

cloudflared reaches Caddy on its own listener, `caddy:8080`, never published. That listener trusts
the Compose network as a proxy and takes the visitor's address from `Cf-Connecting-Ip`, which the
Cloudflare edge sets (and refuses with 403 when a visitor sends it). The published `:80` trusts
nobody. Either way the api receives exactly one `X-Forwarded-For` and logs it as `client`.

The service sits in the Compose profile `tunnel`, which `deploy.sh` enables on the Jetson. Neither
the dev stack nor a plain `docker compose -f compose.yml up` on the Mac opens a public tunnel.
